# Gesture-Controlled Open World Game:

Welcome to the Gesture-Controlled Open World Game project! This project allows you to control an open-world game using posture and gesture recognition. The entire project is implemented in Python, making use of the following libraries: mediapipe, sklearn,open-cv and pyautogui.

## **Overview:**

This project explores the integration of gesture and posture recognition to enhance the user experience in an open-world game. By utilizing computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms, the player can interact with the game environment using natural gestures and postures.

## **Features:**

### _Gesture Recognition:_ The project employs the mediapipe library to recognize and interpret gestures made by the player using a camera.

### _Posture Recognition: _The player's posture is analyzed using mediapipe to detect specific body positions and movements.

### _Machine Learning with sklearn:_ The project utilizes machine learning models from the sklearn library to classify and interpret gestures and postures, providing a seamless interaction experience.

### _Game Control with pyautogui:_ The pyautogui library is employed to simulate keyboard and mouse inputs, enabling control of the open-world game based on the recognized gestures and postures.

## **WORKING** :


_X = PALYER_IN_THE GAME_

### To move the X **forward**  your  **left_wrist** and **right_wrist** should **cross** each other **above your chest **.

## To** move the mouse** for adjust the angle of **X's vision **, you should** fully open your left hand **and the mouse will move in the direction in which your** right_hand's index finger indicates.**

## To make the **X to shoot** you should **fully close your left hand** and your **right hand** shoud be in **gun_gesture** form.

## To make X **to reload the gun**  you should **fully close your left hand** and your **right_hand's thump_tip and index_finger_tip will close together and other three fingers should point upwards.**

## To make X **to jump**  you should **fully close your left hand** and your **right_hand's  index_finger should poit upward and you thum_finger sholudbe in normal and other three finers should be in closed form.

## **Setup:**
### **Install the required libraries:**
mediapipe
scikitlearn
open-cv
pyautogui

_Clone the repository:_  [Game_controller]((https://github.com/Mohanraj2045/Machine-Learning/tree/main/open_world_game_controller))

## **Run the main script:**

_python main.py_

## **Usage**:

Make sure you have a webcam connected to your system.

Launch the open-world game.

Execute the main.py script from this project.

The script will use the camera to detect your gestures and postures, translating them into game control commands.

Enjoy playing the open-world game with gesture and posture control!
